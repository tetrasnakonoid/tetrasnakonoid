protip: you can't
Crazy libGDX game where you must play Snake Tetris and Arcanoid simultaneously.
It's challengable easy to learn hard to master timekiller and frustration generator like FlappyBird or even better.
Expect serious butthurt while playing this.

If you really want to build it yourself make dummy libgdx project called "Tetrasnakonoid" with classpath com.tetranakonoid.game
Then replace source code file in the core folder and copy assets folder to /android/assets and /core/assets in your newly created 
libgdx project folder. After that build it on all html, desktop, ios, android targets with default build.gradle with Android Studio. 

Tested libGDX version is 1.9.8.
